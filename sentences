 She had asked Nora to look after
Jane Gladys, and Nora promised she would But it was her afternoon
for polishing the silver, so she stayed in the pantry and left Jane
Gladys to amuse herself alone in the big sitting-room upstairs Jane Gladys thought
it was Nora, so she didn't look up until she had taken a couple more
stitches on a forget-me-not Then she raised her eyes and was
astonished to find a strange man in the middle of the room, who
regarded her earnestly "Are you Jane Gladys Brown?"

"Yes, sir," she answered"

"How did you get in?" inquired Jane Gladys, with a growing distrust
of her visitor"

Jane Gladys got off the window sill and pointed her small finger at
the door "My papa is the best man in the world

"Why," continued the man, with growing excitement, "he ordered me
from his office, and had me put out of the building by the janitor!
What do you think of such treatment as that from the 'best papa in
the world,' eh?"

"I think he was quite right," said Jane Gladys"

Jane Gladys shivered Now this," he continued, rising and handing her the book
with a bow, "is my revenge for your father's treatment of me"

He walked to the door, gave her another bow, and left the room, and
Jane Gladys could see that he was laughing to himself as if very
much amused

When the door had closed behind the queer little man the child sat
down in the window again and glanced at the book

When the door had closed behind the queer little man the child sat
down in the window again and glanced at the book While
she looked at this the book trembled in her hands, the leaf crackled
and creaked and suddenly the clown jumped out of it and stood upon
the floor beside her, becoming instantly as big as any ordinary
clown"

Perhaps you can imagine how startled Jane Gladys was, and how she
stared at the clown who had just leaped out of the book"

Perhaps you can imagine how startled Jane Gladys was, and how she
stared at the clown who had just leaped out of the book Then he turned around to take a
look at the room and Jane Gladys laughed in spite of her
astonishment He wasn't expected to make the back of me, for
that was against the page of the book"

"But it makes you look so funny!" said Jane Gladys, laughing until
her eyes were moist with tears

"I'm not the only thing in the book," he remarked, crossly

"I'm not the only thing in the book," he remarked, crossly

This reminded her to turn another page, and she had scarcely noted
that it contained the picture of a monkey when the animal sprang
from the book with a great crumpling of paper and landed upon the
window seat beside her"

"Real monkeys can't talk," said Jane Gladys, reprovingly She thoughtlessly turned
another leaf, and before she had time to look twice a gray donkey
leaped from the book and stumbled from the window seat to the floor
with a great clatter"

"What's wrong with you?" asked Jane Gladys"

"Don't mind that," said the monkey, making a spring at the
chandelier and swinging from it by his tail until Jane Gladys feared
he would knock all the globes off; "the same artist has made my ears
as big as that clown's and everyone knows a monkey hasn't any ears
to speak of--much less to draw"

Jane Gladys looked from one to the other with a puzzled expression
upon her sweet face, and turned another page of the book"

Jane Gladys looked from one to the other with a puzzled expression
upon her sweet face, and turned another page of the book

The leopard crouched upon the back of the chair, lashed his tail
from side to side and glared at all of them, by turns, including
Jane Gladys

Just then the book slipped from the girl's lap, and as she made a
movement to catch it one of the pages near the back opened wide She
caught a glimpse of a fierce grizzly bear looking at her from the
page, and quickly threw the book from her It fell with a crash in
the middle of the room, but beside it stood the great grizzly, who
had wrenched himself from the page before the book closed
"you may begin eating Jane Gladys as soon as you wish"

Jane Gladys was much frightened on hearing this conversation, and
she began to realize what the man meant when he said he gave her the
book to be revenged

"This is the way I look in the book," he said

"This is the way I look in the book," he said"

He advanced slowly toward Jane Gladys, and the monkey, the leopard,
the donkey and the clown all stood around in a circle and watched
the bear with much interest

"Why, the book was given to me; my name's on the front leaf And you
belong, by rights, in the book And you
belong, by rights, in the book Is her name really in the book?"

The clown picked it up and looked at the name Is her name really in the book?"

The clown picked it up and looked at the name "'Jane Gladys Brown;' and written quite plainly in
big letters

"The fault lies with yourselves," said Jane Gladys, severely "Why
didn't you stay in the book, where you were put?"

The animals looked at each other in a foolish way, and the clown
blushed under his white paint "Why
didn't you stay in the book, where you were put?"

The animals looked at each other in a foolish way, and the clown
blushed under his white paint

"It's mamma!" cried Jane Gladys, springing to her feet Now, you stupid creatures--"

But she was interrupted by them all making a rush for the book
There was a swish and a whirr and a rustling of leaves, and an
instant later the book lay upon the floor looking just like any
other book, while Jane Gladys' strange companions had all
disappeared

This story should teach us to think quickly and clearly upon all
occasions; for had Jane Gladys not remembered that she owned the
bear he probably would have eaten her before the bell rang
