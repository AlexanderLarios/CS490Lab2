Mamma
had
gone
down-town
to
shop
She
had
asked
Nora
to
look
after
Jane
Gladys
and
Nora
promised
she
would
But
it
wa
her
afternoon
for
polishing
the
silver
so
she
stayed
in
the
pantry
and
left
Jane
Gladys
to
amuse
herself
alone
in
the
big
sitting-room
upstairs
The
little
girl
did
not
mind
being
alone
for
she
wa
working
on
her
first
piece
of
embroidery
--
a
sofa
pillow
for
papa
s
birthday
present
So
she
crept
into
the
big
bay
window
and
curled
herself
up
on
the
broad
sill
while
she
bent
her
brown
head
over
her
work
Soon
the
door
opened
and
closed
again
quietly
Jane
Gladys
thought
it
wa
Nora
so
she
didn
t
look
up
until
she
had
taken
a
couple
more
stitch
on
a
forget-me-not
Then
she
raised
her
eye
and
wa
astonished
to
find
a
strange
man
in
the
middle
of
the
room
who
regarded
her
earnestly
He
wa
short
and
fat
and
seemed
to
be
breathing
heavily
from
his
climb
up
the
stair
He
held
a
work
silk
hat
in
one
hand
and
underneath
his
other
elbow
wa
tucked
a
good-sized
book
He
wa
dressed
in
a
black
suit
that
looked
old
and
rather
shabby
and
his
head
wa
bald
upon
the
top
''
Excuse
me
``
he
said
while
the
child
gazed
at
him
in
solemn
surprise
``
Are
you
Jane
Gladys
Brown
``
''
Yes
sir
``
she
answered
''
Very
good
very
good
indeed
!
''
he
remarked
with
a
queer
sort
of
smile
``
I
ve
had
quite
a
hunt
to
find
you
but
I
ve
succeeded
at
last
``
''
How
did
you
get
in
``
inquired
Jane
Gladys
with
a
growing
distrust
of
her
visitor
''
That
is
a
secret
``
he
said
mysteriously
This
wa
enough
to
put
the
girl
on
her
guard
She
looked
at
the
man
and
the
man
looked
at
her
and
both
look
were
grave
and
somewhat
anxious
''
What
do
you
want
``
she
asked
straightening
herself
up
with
a
dignified
air
''
Ah
!
--
now
we
are
coming
to
business
``
said
the
man
briskly
``
I
m
going
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
To
begin
with
your
father
ha
abused
me
in
a
most
ungentlemanly
manner
``
Jane
Gladys
got
off
the
window
sill
and
pointed
her
small
finger
at
the
door
''
Leave
this
room
meejitly
!
''
she
cried
her
voice
trembling
with
indignation
``
My
papa
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
He
never
bused
anybody
!
''
``
Allow
me
to
explain
please
``
said
the
visitor
without
paying
any
attention
to
her
request
to
go
away
``
Your
father
may
be
very
kind
to
you
for
you
are
his
little
girl
you
know
But
when
he
s
down-town
in
his
office
he
s
inclined
to
be
rather
severe
especially
on
book
agent
Now
I
called
on
him
the
other
day
and
asked
him
to
buy
the
Complete
Works
of
Peter
Smith
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
``
She
said
nothing
''
Why
``
continued
the
man
with
growing
excitement
``
he
ordered
me
from
his
office
and
had
me
put
out
of
the
building
by
the
janitor
!
What
do
you
think
of
such
treatment
a
that
from
the
best
papa
in
the
world
eh
``
''
I
think
he
wa
quite
right
``
said
Jane
Gladys
''
Oh
you
do
Well
``
said
the
man
``
I
resolved
to
be
revenged
for
the
insult
So
a
your
father
is
big
and
strong
and
a
dangerous
man
I
have
decided
to
be
revenged
upon
his
little
girl
``
Jane
Gladys
shivered
''
What
are
you
going
to
do
``
she
asked
''
I
m
going
to
present
you
with
this
book
``
he
answered
taking
it
from
under
his
arm
Then
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
placed
his
hat
on
the
rug
and
drew
a
fountain
pen
from
his
vest
pocket
''
I
ll
write
your
name
in
it
``
said
he
``
How
do
you
spell
Gladys
``
''
G-l-a-d-y-s
``
she
replied
''
Thank
you
Now
this
``
he
continued
rising
and
handing
her
the
book
with
a
bow
``
is
my
revenge
for
your
father
s
treatment
of
me
Perhaps
he
ll
be
sorry
he
didn
t
buy
the
Complete
Works
of
Peter
Smith
Good-by
my
dear
``
He
walked
to
the
door
gave
her
another
bow
and
left
the
room
and
Jane
Gladys
could
see
that
he
wa
laughing
to
himself
a
if
very
much
amused
When
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
queer
little
man
the
child
sat
down
in
the
window
again
and
glanced
at
the
book
It
had
a
red
and
yellow
cover
and
the
word
``
Thingamajigs
''
wa
across
the
front
in
big
letter
Then
she
opened
it
curiously
and
saw
her
name
written
in
black
letter
upon
the
first
white
leaf
''
He
wa
a
funny
little
man
``
she
said
to
herself
thoughtfully
She
turned
the
next
leaf
and
saw
a
big
picture
of
a
clown
dressed
in
green
and
red
and
yellow
and
having
a
very
white
face
with
three-cornered
spot
of
red
on
each
cheek
and
over
the
eye
While
she
looked
at
this
the
book
trembled
in
her
hand
the
leaf
crackled
and
creaked
and
suddenly
the
clown
jumped
out
of
it
and
stood
upon
the
floor
beside
her
becoming
instantly
a
big
a
any
ordinary
clown
After
stretching
his
arm
and
leg
and
yawning
in
a
rather
impolite
manner
he
gave
a
silly
chuckle
and
said
''
This
is
better
!
You
don
t
know
how
cramped
one
get
standing
so
long
upon
a
page
of
flat
paper
``
Perhaps
you
can
imagine
how
startled
Jane
Gladys
wa
and
how
she
stared
at
the
clown
who
had
just
leaped
out
of
the
book
''
You
didn
t
expect
anything
of
this
sort
did
you
``
he
asked
leering
at
her
in
clown
fashion
Then
he
turned
around
to
take
a
look
at
the
room
and
Jane
Gladys
laughed
in
spite
of
her
astonishment
''
What
amuses
you
``
demanded
the
clown
''
Why
the
back
of
you
is
all
white
!
''
cried
the
girl
``
You
re
only
a
clown
in
front
of
you
``
''
Quite
likely
``
he
returned
in
an
annoyed
tone
``
The
artist
made
a
front
view
of
me
He
wasn
t
expected
to
make
the
back
of
me
for
that
wa
against
the
page
of
the
book
``
''
But
it
make
you
look
so
funny
!
''
said
Jane
Gladys
laughing
until
her
eye
were
moist
with
tear
The
clown
looked
sulky
and
sat
down
upon
a
chair
so
she
couldn
t
see
his
back
''
I
m
not
the
only
thing
in
the
book
``
he
remarked
crossly
This
reminded
her
to
turn
another
page
and
she
had
scarcely
noted
that
it
contained
the
picture
of
a
monkey
when
the
animal
sprang
from
the
book
with
a
great
crumpling
of
paper
and
landed
upon
the
window
seat
beside
her
''
He-he-he-he-he
!
''
chattered
the
creature
springing
to
the
girl
s
shoulder
and
then
to
the
center
table
``
This
is
great
fun
!
Now
I
can
be
a
real
monkey
instead
of
a
picture
of
one
``
''
Real
monkey
can
t
talk
``
said
Jane
Gladys
reprovingly
''
How
do
you
know
Have
you
ever
been
one
yourself
``
inquired
the
animal
and
then
he
laughed
loudly
and
the
clown
laughed
too
a
if
he
enjoyed
the
remark
The
girl
wa
quite
bewildered
by
this
time
She
thoughtlessly
turned
another
leaf
and
before
she
had
time
to
look
twice
a
gray
donkey
leaped
from
the
book
and
stumbled
from
the
window
seat
to
the
floor
with
a
great
clatter
''
You
re
clumsy
enough
I
m
sure
!
''
said
the
child
indignantly
for
the
beast
had
nearly
upset
her
''
Clumsy
!
And
why
not
``
demanded
the
donkey
with
angry
voice
``
If
the
fool
artist
had
drawn
you
out
of
perspective
a
he
did
me
I
guess
you
d
be
clumsy
yourself
``
''
What
s
wrong
with
you
``
asked
Jane
Gladys
''
My
front
and
rear
leg
on
the
left
side
are
nearly
six
inch
too
short
that
s
what
s
the
matter
!
If
that
artist
didn
t
know
how
to
draw
properly
why
did
he
try
to
make
a
donkey
at
all
``
''
I
don
t
know
``
replied
the
child
seeing
an
answer
wa
expected
''
I
can
hardly
stand
up
``
grumbled
the
donkey
``
and
the
least
little
thing
will
topple
me
over
``
''
Don
t
mind
that
``
said
the
monkey
making
a
spring
at
the
chandelier
and
swinging
from
it
by
his
tail
until
Jane
Gladys
feared
he
would
knock
all
the
globe
off
``
the
same
artist
ha
made
my
ear
a
big
a
that
clown
s
and
everyone
know
a
monkey
hasn
t
any
ear
to
speak
of
--
much
le
to
draw
``
''
He
should
be
prosecuted
``
remarked
the
clown
gloomily
``
I
haven
t
any
back
``
Jane
Gladys
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
puzzled
expression
upon
her
sweet
face
and
turned
another
page
of
the
book
Swift
a
a
flash
there
sprang
over
her
shoulder
a
tawney
spotted
leopard
which
landed
upon
the
back
of
a
big
leather
armchair
and
turned
upon
the
others
with
a
fierce
movement
The
monkey
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
chandelier
and
chattered
with
fright
The
donkey
tried
to
run
and
straightway
tipped
over
on
his
left
side
The
clown
grew
paler
than
ever
but
he
sat
still
in
his
chair
and
gave
a
low
whistle
of
surprise
The
leopard
crouched
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
lashed
his
tail
from
side
to
side
and
glared
at
all
of
them
by
turn
including
Jane
Gladys
''
Which
of
u
are
you
going
to
attack
first
``
asked
the
donkey
trying
hard
to
get
upon
his
foot
again
''
I
can
t
attack
any
of
you
``
snarled
the
leopard
``
The
artist
made
my
mouth
shut
so
I
haven
t
any
teeth
and
he
forgot
to
make
my
claw
But
I
m
a
frightful
looking
creature
nevertheless
am
I
not
``
''
Oh
yes
``
said
the
clown
indifferently
``
I
suppose
you
re
frightful
looking
enough
But
if
you
have
no
teeth
nor
claw
we
don
t
mind
your
look
at
all
``
This
so
annoyed
the
leopard
that
he
growled
horribly
and
the
monkey
laughed
at
him
Just
then
the
book
slipped
from
the
girl
s
lap
and
a
she
made
a
movement
to
catch
it
one
of
the
page
near
the
back
opened
wide
She
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fierce
grizzly
bear
looking
at
her
from
the
page
and
quickly
threw
the
book
from
her
It
fell
with
a
crash
in
the
middle
of
the
room
but
beside
it
stood
the
great
grizzly
who
had
wrenched
himself
from
the
page
before
the
book
closed
''
Now
``
cried
the
leopard
from
his
perch
``
you
d
better
look
out
for
yourselves
!
You
can
t
laugh
at
him
a
you
did
at
me
The
bear
ha
both
claw
and
teeth
``
''
Indeed
I
have
``
said
the
bear
in
a
low
deep
growling
voice
``
And
I
know
how
to
use
them
too
If
you
read
in
that
book
you
ll
find
I
m
described
a
a
horrible
cruel
and
remorseless
grizzly
whose
only
business
in
life
is
to
eat
up
little
girl
--
shoe
dress
ribbon
and
all
!
And
then
the
author
say
I
smack
my
lip
and
glory
in
my
wickedness
``
''
That
s
awful
!

said
the
donkey
sitting
upon
his
haunch
and
shaking
his
head
sadly
``
What
do
you
suppose
possessed
the
author
to
make
you
so
hungry
for
girl
Do
you
eat
animal
also

''
The
author
doe
not
mention
my
eating
anything
but
little
girl

replied
the
bear
''
Very
good

remarked
the
clown
drawing
a
long
breath
of
relief
''
you
may
begin
eating
Jane
Gladys
a
soon
a
you
wish
She
laughed
because
I
had
no
back

''
And
she
laughed
because
my
leg
are
out
of
perspective
``
brayed

donkey
''
But
you
also
deserve
to
be
eaten
``
screamed
the
leopard
from
the
back
of
the
leather
chair
``
for
you
laughed
and
poked
fun
at
me
because
I
had
no
claw
nor
teeth

Don
t
you
suppose
Mr
Grizzly
you
could
manage
to
eat
a
clown
a
donkey
and
a
monkey
after
you
finish
the
girl
``
''
Perhaps
so
and
a
leopard
into
the
bargain
``
growled
the
bear
``
It
will
depend
on
how
hungry
I
am
But
I
must
begin
on
the
little
girl
first
because
the
author
say
I
prefer
girl
to
anything
``
Jane
Gladys
wa
much
frightened
on
hearing
this
conversation
and
she
began
to
realize
what
the
man
meant
when
he
said
he
gave
her
the
book
to
be
revenged
Surely
papa
would
be
sorry
he
hadn
t
bought
the
''
Complete
Works
of
Peter
Smith
''
when
he
came
home
and
found
his
little
girl
eaten
up
by
a
grizzly
bear
--
shoe
dress
ribbon
and
all
!
The
bear
stood
up
and
balanced
himself
on
his
rear
leg
''
This
is
the
way
I
look
in
the
book
``
he
said
``
Now
watch
me
eat
the
little
girl
``
He
advanced
slowly
toward
Jane
Gladys
and
the
monkey
the
leopard
the
donkey
and
the
clown
all
stood
around
in
a
circle
and
watched
the
bear
with
much
interest
But
before
the
grizzly
reached
her
the
child
had
a
sudden
thought
and
cried
out
''
Stop
!
You
mustn
t
eat
me
It
would
be
wrong
``
''
Why
``
asked
the
bear
in
surprise
''
Because
I
own
you
You
re
my
private
property
``
she
answered
''
I
don
t
see
how
you
make
that
out
``
said
the
bear
in
a
disappointed
tone
''
Why
the
book
wa
given
to
me
my
name
s
on
the
front
leaf
And
you
belong
by
right
in
the
book
So
you
mustn
t
dare
to
eat
your
owner
!
''
The
Grizzly
hesitated
''
Can
any
of
you
read
``
he
asked
''
I
can
``
said
the
clown
''
Then
see
if
she
speaks
the
truth
Is
her
name
really
in
the
book
``
The
clown
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
the
name
''
It
is
``
said
he
``
Jane
Gladys
Brown
and
written
quite
plainly
in
big
letter
``
The
bear
sighed
''
Then
of
course
I
can
t
eat
her
``
he
decided
``
That
author
is
a
disappointing
a
most
author
are
``
''
But
he
s
not
a
bad
a
the
artist
``
exclaimed
the
donkey
who
wa
still
trying
to
stand
up
straight
''
The
fault
lie
with
yourselves
``
said
Jane
Gladys
severely
``
Why
didn
t
you
stay
in
the
book
where
you
were
put
``
The
animal
looked
at
each
other
in
a
foolish
way
and
the
clown
blushed
under
his
white
paint
''
Really
--
''
began
the
bear
and
then
he
stopped
short
The
door
bell
rang
loudly
''
It
s
mamma
!
''
cried
Jane
Gladys
springing
to
her
foot
``
She
s
come
home
at
last
Now
you
stupid
creature

''
But
she
wa
interrupted
by
them
all
making
a
rush
for
the
book
There
wa
a
swish
and
a
whirr
and
a
rustling
of
leaf
and
an
instant
later
the
book
lay
upon
the
floor
looking
just
like
any
other
book
while
Jane
Gladys
strange
companion
had
all
disappeared

This
story
should
teach
u
to
think
quickly
and
clearly
upon
all
occasion
for
had
Jane
Gladys
not
remembered
that
she
owned
the
bear
he
probably
would
have
eaten
her
before
the
bell
rang
